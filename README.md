# til - Today I Learned

Here is a collection of tidbits and items I've learned along my coding journey.

This repo is inspired by the @jbrandchaud/til repo and the Learning in Public idea/movement.

I'll be starting off with some things I already 'know'. But don't implement often in an effort to create a habit of updating this every day.
