# til - Today I Learned

Here is a collection of tidbits and items I've learned along my coding journey.

This repo is inspired by the @jbrandchaud/til repo and the Learning in Public idea/movement.

I'll be starting off with some things I already 'know'. But don't implement often in an effort to create a habit of updating this every day.

## Topics I've Learned
date| topic | language/framework | breakdown |
----| ----|----| ----|
4/1/2023 |"__dirname" | expressjs | gives the directory name of the current module |
6/1/2023 |"quicksight" |  SQL | curly brackets {} denotes a variable being used within the sql query | 
6/7/2023 |"SQL query" | SQL | aggregates are not allowed in the GROUP BY clause |
6/15/2023 |"SQL query" | SQL | can use EXTRACT('week' FROM date_column) or DATE_PART('week', date_column) to get the week number from a date |
6/27/2023 |"trunc/date_trunc" | SQL | differences: trunc works for both dates and floats, date_trunc works for dates only but can truncate specific date parts (day/month/week/etc) |
7/26/2023 |"interval" | SQL | used to help calculate date and time values |
